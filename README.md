# Pizza
 Strongmind exercise

 
1. Research & Insights: Document your understanding of the potential users and any assumptions you make during the design process.

- Potential users of Pizza Palace include the store owner, store manager, and chef.
- Assumptions: Users will need to add, remove, or edit toppings on the ordering page. I assumed that a pizza store owner may not be highly familiar with technology, so I focused on streamlining the workflow. Additionally, I aimed to keep the user interface as simple and aesthetically pleasing as possible.

2. Wireframes & User Flows

5. Documentation

- Since I didn’t have time to collect actual user feedback, I put myself in the user’s shoes. I imagined myself as a pizza store owner and considered what I would need from the system.
- I came up with several key features, including the ability to add, edit, and remove toppings or pizzas. The most complex feature would be the "add" function, as users might make errors, such as adding duplicate items. I focused on minimizing the number of steps in the process and provided a notification if a duplicate item was added.
